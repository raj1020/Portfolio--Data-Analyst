# Portfolio--Data-Analyst
# **Raj Lamichhane - Data-Analyst-Portfolio**
## **About**
ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I am Raj Lamichhane and I am a **Microsoft Certified Power BI Data Analyst**. I have a diverse background in ranging from Data Analytics to Banking, Admin in Aged Care, and Transportation in both Australia and abroad. I have recently completed Data Analytics Bootcamp from Generation Australia. I have developed a strong foundation in Data Analytics, business and economics and a passion for using data to uncover meaningful insights. I am excited to bring my technical and analytical skills to the field of data science as a data analyst.

While working as a Data Analyst for the Consumer Banking division of a Bank in Nepal, I regularly prepared reports and dashboards to support the leadership team in decision-making.I collaborated with internal and external stakeholders by sharing insights and interactive visualisations. I extensively used Power BI, Excel and SQL for data analysis and for ensuring data integrity and accuracy. My data driven insights and close collaboration with other internal stakeholders such as sales, credit, collection and recovery teams helped the bank to reduce its nonperforming assets. 

During my Data Analytics bootcamp in Generation Australia, I further honed my ability to work with complex data and developed a keen eye for identifying patterns and trends. I also gained further experience using various tools like Python, SQL, Shell, Git and PowerBI for the purpose of Data Analysis, which I believe will be valuable assets in my role as a data analyst.

In my free time, I enjoy exploring new data analysis tools and techniques, and I am always looking for opportunities to expand my knowledge and skills. Whether working on a team or independently, I am driven by the thrill of discovering new insights and the satisfaction of using data to solve complex problems.

This is a repository to showcase skills, share projects and track my progress in Data Analytics related topics.
